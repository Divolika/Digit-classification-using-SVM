# Digit-classification-using-SVM
Digit classification using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm in machine learning involves training a model on labeled images of handwritten digits. The SVM algorithm finds the optimal hyperplane that separates digit classes with maximum margin, enabling accurate recognition of digits from new, unseen images.
