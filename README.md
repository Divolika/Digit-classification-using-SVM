# Digit Classification using SVM Algorithm

This repository contains Python code demonstrating digit classification using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm in machine learning. The code utilizes the popular scikit-learn library for SVM implementation and pandas for data manipulation.

## Overview

Digit classification is a common task in machine learning, especially in the field of computer vision. It involves recognizing handwritten digits from images. SVM is a powerful algorithm for classification tasks and has been widely used for digit recognition due to its effectiveness.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is available as a CSV file named `digit_svm.csv`. It contains labeled images of handwritten digits, where each row represents an image and the first column represents the digit label.

## Dependencies

- Python 3
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/digit-classification-svm.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd digit-classification-svm
```

3. Run the Python script:

```
python digit_classification_svm.py
```

This will preprocess the data, train the SVM classifier, make predictions on the test set, and evaluate the model's performance.

## Results

The script will display a confusion matrix and accuracy score, providing insights into the model's performance in digit classification.
